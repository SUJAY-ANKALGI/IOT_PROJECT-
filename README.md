# IOT_PROJECT-
Current &amp; Voltage Monitoring with Arduino (ACS712)  This project measures real-time voltage and current from a DC load using an ACS712 Hall-effect current sensor and an analog voltage divider connected to an Arduino. The data is read by the Arduinoâ€™s ADC and displayed on the Serial Monitor.
